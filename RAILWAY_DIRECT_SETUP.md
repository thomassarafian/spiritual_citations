## Comparison: Kamal vs Direct Railway

### Kamal Approach (What we set up):
✅ **Pros:**
- Full control over deployment process
- Can deploy to multiple platforms
- Professional deployment workflow
- Easy to manage secrets

❌ **Cons:**
- Requires Docker Hub account
- More complex setup
- Need to manage Docker images

### Direct Railway Approach:
✅ **Pros:**
- Simpler setup
- No Docker Hub needed
- Automatic builds from Git
- Railway handles everything

❌ **Cons:**
- Less control over deployment
- Tied to Railway.app only
- Less professional workflow

## Recommendation

**For learning:** Use Direct Railway approach (simpler)
**For production:** Use Kamal approach (more professional)

## Quick Direct Setup Commands

If you want to try the direct approach:

1. **Remove Kamal files:**
```bash
rm -rf .kamal/
rm config/deploy.yml
rm deploy.sh
```

2. **Add Railway.app configuration:**
```bash
# Create railway.json (optional)
echo '{"build": {"builder": "NIXPACKS"}}' > railway.json
```

3. **Deploy directly:**
- Just push to GitHub
- Railway.app will auto-deploy

## Mindful Choice
